## Important Notes

### Antivirus Warnings

Some antivirus software may flag keystroke simulation tools as potentially unwanted. This is a false positive. The application:
- Is open source
- Only simulates keypresses locally
- Does not send data anywhere
- Does not record your keystrokes

If your antivirus blocks the application, you may need to add it to your exclusions list.
